 ---virtual Environment
	----packetTracer application
		----Switch             			: that has to be managed
		----laptop/desktop			: used to access the switch and display all contents of the switch
		----console Cable			: to access the switch from the laptop to view and change configuration locally.
		----Lan Cable				: to transfer data or files from switch to the laptop/server and vice-versa.
		----putty/hyperTerminal/TeraTerm	: to provide an interface to connect with the switch from laptop and manage the configuration
		----tftp server				: to backup data of switch on the server and restore data from server to the switch.

what to do on a switch
	--- connect the switch from laptop/desktop using console cable
	--- connect the switch from server[tftp] using lan cable
	--- access the switch from laptop using putty(physical)/terminal(packettracer)

	--- view some settings and configuration  		[Rec. : use all show commands in privilage Mode]
		---- show flash memory 			[show flash:]
		---- show runnig-config			[show running-config]
		---- show startup-config		[show startup-config]
		---- show version			[show version ]
		---- show vlan information		[show vlan]
		---- show port information		[show ip interface brief]
		---- show cam table			[show mac-address-table]

	--- show files					[show flash: ]
	--- rename files				[rename old file name new file name]
	--- delete file					[delete file name]
	--- delete startup-config			[erase startup-configuration]
	--- save running-config into startup-config	[copy running-config startup-config]
	--- save startup-config into tftp server	[copy startup-config flash: ]
	--- restore startup-config from tftp server	[copy tftp: startup-config ]
	--- copy startup-config into running-config	[copy startup-config running-config ]

	--- change setting / configuration [Rec. : all given bellow commands should be run in global configuration mode ]
		--- change hostname			[hostname newhostname]
		--- change access mode password		[enable secret newpassword ]
		--- set ip address on the switch	[interface vlan1 ---> ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 ----> no shutdown]
		--- change console mode password	[line console 0 ---> password newPassword ----> login ]
		--- enable telnet			[line vty 0 15 ---->password newTelnetpassword ---->login---> exit ]
		--- save all current settings		[do copy running-config startup-config ]
		--- break switch password			[reboot the switch--->press mode button for 5-10 sec----> flash_init --->ren config.text hub.text-->boot the swtich]
